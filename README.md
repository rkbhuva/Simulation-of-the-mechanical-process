### ðŸ§© Assignments

**Handin 1 â€” Euler & Rungeâ€“Kutta Methods**  
Simulation of the winnowing process using Euler and Rungeâ€“Kutta integration schemes to track particle trajectories.

**Handin 2 â€” Monte Carlo Method**  
Simulation of particle motion during winnowing using the Monte Carlo approach to model particle trajectories with random properties of particles.

**Handin 3 â€” Particle Collision Models**  
Simulation of particle collisions using:
- **Hard-sphere model** for ideal elastic collisions  
- **Soft-sphere model (Discrete Element Method)** for realistic deformation and contact interactions
